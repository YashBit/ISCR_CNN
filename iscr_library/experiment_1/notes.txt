        2. What are those metrics?
        3. 

4. Build Charts like Paper 1


















## Experiment 1: Compound vs Continuous Letters

1. Cognitive Science Concept derived from  Hypothesis
    1. Hypothesis: Orientation of continuous and compound letters is not represented in the same layer (Keyword → layer)
2. Human Experimental Suite / Data
    1. 5.8/5.9 → From Davida 
3. Computational Experiment → #5 
    1. Relation #2 AND #1
        1. DNNs represent the visual stream 
            1. Compound vs Non Compound Shape 
    2. Assumptions which relate to the cognitive concept
        1. DNNs represent visual stream
    3. Needs to prove/relative #1 -> Cognitive Science Concept
        1. **LATER** 
4. Bring Psychological Representations closer to Computational Experiment Closer
    1. **LATER** 
5. THEORY FOR EXPERIMENT → REFINE WITH GILLES 
    1. Davida cannot identify direction of continuous shapes
    2. But she can identify direction of compound shapes 
    3. Which implies
        1. That there are different visual processing streams for subunits and the highest level unit 
6. Experiment Details → WRITE DOWN CORE IMPLICATIONS OF TRAJECTORIES ( HOW THEY RELATE TO COGNITIVE SCIENCE CONCEPT):
    1. On hold:
        1. Train Model 1 on Compound Exemplar
            1. Not shown the continuous exemplar 
        2. Train Model 2 on Continuous Exemplar
            1. Not shown the compound exemplar 
    2. Train Model 3 (HUMAN CAPABILITY) on Compound and Continuous B
        1. Implies Both Exemplars are of same category
            1. Compound/Continuous B are the SAME
            2. **CORE IMPLICATIONS AND COGNITIVE SCIENCE CONCEPT** 
                1. EXPLICITLY ENCODED TO THE MACHINE Continuous and Compound exemplars are equivalent
                    1. Cognitive Science concept → HUMAN BEINGS understand compound/cont b to be the same 
    3. Test Model 3 on Compound/Continuous Exemplars
        1. Ablate Layers (See Performance Drop)
            1. For compound/continuous separately 

## Engineering Methodology:

1. Models other than DNNs:
    1. Shallow Models:
        1. Pixelwise 
        2. GaborJet
        3. Histogram of Oriented Gradient
        4. Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradient 
        5. Pyramid Histogram of Visual Words
    2. HMAX Models 
        1. HMAX 99’ 
        2. HMIN
        3. HMAX-PNAS
2. Deep Models:
    1. Models:
        1. GoogleLeNet
        2. VGG
        3. ResNet 
    2. Image Set:
        1. Compound/Continuous Set 
            1. 2000 Images for each letter 
                1. 1000 for continuous 
                2. 1000 for compound
            2. Total:
                1. 52,000 Images 
    3. **IMPORTANT DECISION: TRAINING**
        1. PRETRAINED ON IMAGENET + FINETUNED ON OUR USECASE 
        2. FULLY TRAINED ONLY ON OUR USECASE, NO IMAGENET WEIGHTS 
3. EVALUATION:
    1. Bar chart of performance like paper 1
    2. Ablation Testing:
        1. Bar Performance
        2. Compound vs Continuous Shapes 
        3. Each model and each layer frozen
            1. Then see performance charts
